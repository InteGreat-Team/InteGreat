# Middleware Directory 🛡️

## Purpose 🎯
Middleware processes requests before they reach controllers. It is used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, validation, and logging.

## Common Middleware 🔒
- **Authentication**: Verify JWT tokens or API keys.
- **Validation**: Validate request data using schemas.
- **Logging**: Log incoming requests and responses.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of the API.

## Usage 🛠️
Middleware is applied at the route or application level.
