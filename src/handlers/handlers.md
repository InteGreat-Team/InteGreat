# Handlers Directory 🖐️

## Purpose 🎯
Handlers manage AWS Lambda functions, often used for processing asynchronous operations, API Gateway requests, or other event-driven tasks.

## Responsibilities 📋
- Execute AWS Lambda functions.
- Handle events from AWS services (e.g., API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB).
- Perform operations that do not require immediate HTTP responses.

## Common Handlers 🔄
- **API Handlers**: Process API Gateway requests.
- **Event Handlers**: Respond to events from AWS services.
- **Task Handlers**: Perform scheduled or recurring tasks using CloudWatch Events.

## Best Practices 🌟
- Keep handlers focused on a single responsibility.
- Ensure handlers are idempotent (safe to run multiple times).
- Use logging to track handler execution and errors.
