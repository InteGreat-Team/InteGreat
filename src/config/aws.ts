/**
 * AWS SDK Configuration
 * 
 * This file is a placeholder for future AWS SDK integration.
 * 
 * Current Implementation Status:
 * - In the current sprint, we are only using the Serverless Framework
 *   to manage AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
 * - No direct AWS SDK calls are being made in this sprint.
 * 
 * Future Plans:
 * - This file will be expanded in future sprints to include direct AWS SDK integrations.
 * - Potential AWS services that may be integrated include:
 *   - S3 for file storage
 *   - SES for email services
 *   - CloudWatch for logging
 *   - DynamoDB for additional data storage
 *   - SNS/SQS for messaging
 * 
 * When implementing AWS SDK in future sprints, we will configure
 * credentials and region settings in this file.
