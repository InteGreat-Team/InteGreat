- **Production**: AWS CDK 🏗️

## Production Strategy 🏗️
To ensure scalability, efficiency, and high availability, Integreat employs a **serverless production strategy**, leveraging AWS Lambda and API Gateway as the backbone for its runtime architecture.

### Serverless Production with AWS Lambda & API Gateway 🌐
- **API Gateway** is configured as the primary entry point for all production traffic.
- Requests are processed by **AWS Lambda** functions, which execute the business and application logic.
- Key production benefits include:
  - **Automatic Scalability**: Seamlessly handles increased traffic during peak times 📈
  - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Costs are incurred only for actual usage, reducing unnecessary expenses 💵
  - **High Availability**: Ensures consistent uptime with a globally distributed and fault-tolerant architecture 🌎

This production strategy aligns with Integreat's vision of delivering a robust and centralized platform for API management and infrastructure.

### Infrastructure Provisioning with AWS CDK in Production 🛡️
For production environments, Integreat utilizes **AWS CDK** to provision and maintain critical cloud resources:
- **AWS Cognito**: Manages authentication and user identity across applications 🔒
- **IAM Roles**: Provides secure and granular access permissions for production applications and services 🔑
- **S3 Buckets**: Centralized storage for production assets and application-specific data 📂

AWS CDK ensures consistency, repeatability, and scalability in managing production infrastructure, reducing manual interventions and errors.

## Local Development & Testing 🖥️
- **Serverless-offline** is used for local testing ⚡
- **AWS SDK** is used when Integreat is deployed locally 🛠️
